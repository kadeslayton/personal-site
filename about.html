  <h4>
    Many of the things that set me apart from your average employee start with how I was raised. I grew up on a large farm in Western New York. As a young child I was instilled with disclipine, work ethic, and taking pride in your work. I worked on my family's farm until I was 19. Betwen the ages of 18 and 20 I worked other jobs while also working for my family's farm. Some of these jobs include Lowes, Pinnacle Rental Centers, and The YMCA. Currently, as implied by my portrait picture on the <a href="./index.html">Home Page</a>, I am apart of the US Army Reserves. Each of these jobs taught me many useful skills that can be used to enhance any workplace enviroment. Some of this skills include:
